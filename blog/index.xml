GDB Debug Stub Support # Cloud Hypervisor can now be used as debug target with GDB. This is controlled by the gdb compile time feature and details of how to use it can be found in the gdb documentation.
virtio-iommu Backed Segments # In order to facilitate hotplug devices that require being behind an IOMMU (e.g. QAT) there is a new option --platform iommu_segments=&amp;lt;list_of_segments&amp;gt; that will place all the specified segments behind the IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v21.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:31:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v21.0 project.
Efficient Local Live Migration (for Live Upgrade) # In order to support fast live upgrade of the VMM an optimised path has been added in which the memory for the VM is not compared from source to destination. This is activated by passing --local to the ch-remote send-migration command. This means that the live upgrade can complete in the order of 50ms vs 3s.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v20.2 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release. The following issues have been addressed:
Don&amp;rsquo;t error out when setting up the SIGWINCH handler (for console resize) when this fails due to older kernel (#3456) Seccomp rules were refined to remove syscalls that are now unused Fix reboot on older host kernels when SIGWINCH handler was not initialised (#3496) Fix virtio-vsock blocking issue (#3497) Download # See the GitHub Release for the release assets.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v20.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 15:06:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release. The following issues have been addressed:
Networking performance regression with virtio-net (#3450) Limit file descriptors sent in vfio-user support (#3401) Fully advertise PCI MMIO config regions in ACPI tables (#3432) Set the TSS and KVM identity maps so they don&amp;rsquo;t overlap with firmware RAM Correctly update the DeviceTree on restore Download # See the GitHub Release for the release assets.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v20.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 16:15:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.0-released/</guid><description>v20.0 # This release has been tracked through the v20.0 project.
Multiple PCI segments support # Cloud Hypervisor is no longer limited to 31 PCI devices. For both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures, it is now possible to create up to 16 PCI segments, increasing the total amount of supported PCI devices to 496.
CPU pinning # For each vCPU, the user can define a limited set of host CPUs on which it is allowed to run.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v19.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v19.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v19.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v19.0 project.
Improved PTY handling for serial and virtio-console # The PTY support for serial has been enhanced with improved buffering when the the PTY is not yet connected to. Using virtio-console with PTY now results in the console being resized if the PTY window is also resized.
PCI boot time optimisations # Multiple optimisations have been made to the PCI handling resulting in significant improvements in the boot time of the guest.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v18.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v18.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 14:31:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v18.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v18.0 project.
Experimental User Device (vfio-user) support # Experimental support for running PCI devices in userspace via vfio-user has been included. This allows the use of the SPDK NVMe vfio-user controller with Cloud Hypervisor. This is enabled by --user-device on the command line.
Migration support for vhost-user devices # Devices exposed into the VM via vhost-user can now be migrated using the live migration support.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v17.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v17.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v17.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v17.0 project.
ARM64 NUMA support using ACPI # The support for ACPI on ARM64 has been enhanced to include support for specifying a NUMA configuration using the existing control options.
Seccomp support for MSHV backend # The seccomp rules have now been extended to support running against the MSHV hypervisor backend.
Hotplug of macvtap devices # Hotplug of macvtap devices is now supported with the file descriptor for the network device if opened by the user and passed to the VMM.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v16.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v16.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 16:13:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v16.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v16.0 project.
Improved live migration support # The live migration support inside Cloud Hypervisor has been improved with the addition of the tracking of dirty pages written by the VMM to complement the tracking of dirty pages made by the guest itself. Further the internal state of the VMM now is versioned which allows the safe migration of VMs from one version of the VMM to a newer one.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v15.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v15.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:27:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v15.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v15.0 project.
Highlights for cloud-hypervisor version v15.0 include:
Version numbering and stability guarantees # This release is the first in a new version numbering scheme to represent that we believe Cloud Hypervisor is maturing and entering a period of stability. With this new release we are beginning our new stability guarantees:
The API (including command line options) will not be removed or changed in a breaking way without a minimum of 2 releases notice.</description></item></channel></rss>
